# Cars_Price_Analysis

For this repository, we strive to explore various characteristics such as the transmission, odometer, car brand and other features as part of the initial phase. Afterwards, we will proceed to clean the data to ensure data quality and consistency which includes handling missing values, correcting data types and dealing with outliers. Lastly, we will perform visualization to visually present data distributions, trends, correlations using various plots and charts.
